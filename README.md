# Introduction

The Goal of making a bowl of cereal is to create a food item which can be consumed for taste and/or nutrients. The consumption of cereal commonly occurs in the morning
but cereal is always good.

# Warning

**Consuming cereal or milk which is expired or has otherwise gone bad can be detrimental to a person's health. If anything tastes wrong about your bowl of cereal, STOP and throw the
contents of the bowl out.**


# You Will Need

* A bowl or similar object
* A spoon
* Cereal (typically comes in a box)
* Milk

# Steps

1. Find all the necessary ingredients and utensils for a bowl of cereal. 

While making cereal is not a time sensitive process it is good to make sure that you have what youneed before you start. It would suck to make a bowl of cereal and
realize all your spoons are dirty.

2. Open the container with the cereal in it.

Most people do not store their cereal loosely so you will need to open the container with the cereal in it.

3. Pour the cereal into the bowl.

Be careful not to tip the cereal container too far or you will end up pouring all of your cereal onto the table or floor.

4. Close the cereal container.

This step will help prevent your cereal from going bad. It will also help prevent unwanted spilling of the remaining cereal during the rest of the process.

5. Pour the milk

This step also requires care. If the milk is tipped too far it will spill. You should also be careful about making sure the cereal that is already inside the bowl 
does not spill either.

6. Close the milk container.

This step will help the milk stay fresh and prevent unwanted spilling.

7. Eat

Use the spoon that you prepared earlier to eat the cereal. 

When you are done eating the cereal you may choose to drink any milk that remains in the bowl.

8. Repeat (Optional)

Repeats steps 1-7 to make and eat another bowl of cereal. When you are done eating cereal move onto the next step.

9. Clean Up

Wash the bowl and spoon you used or place them in a dishwasher. If you used a disposable bowl and spoon you make throw them out in a manner appropriate for the material
that they are made of.

Return the container of cereal and the milk to their proper place as well. This part is especially important for the milk. If this step is not followed the milk will 
spoil faster.
